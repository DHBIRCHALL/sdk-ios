# Development Fixtures
# ====================
#
# A network fixture connects a network URL to a file in the app's resource
# bundle. To add additional fixtures, create a new file added to the
# Example (Fixtures) target and then add a line to this file with the URL
# it is supposed to substitute and the name of the file, separated by a space.
# 
# i.e:
# http://example.com example.json
